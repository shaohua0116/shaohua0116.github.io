## The Site

The site is basically created when exploring  [_jekyll framework_](https://www.http://jekyllrb.com/). <s>After I played enough,</s> I decide to build a website with it for several functionalities:

* __1. Sales Page__

<div class="maxim">
  Just as most personal site did, to <strong>display</strong> my personal achievements for coming opportunities...
</div>

* __2. Mixture of Things__

<div class="maxim">
  Serve as a mixture platform for <strong>projects archive</strong>, personal news, online portfolio and blogs.
</div>
