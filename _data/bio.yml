    me: "I am an <strong>Assistant Professor</strong> at <strong>National Taiwan University (NTU)</strong> with a joint appointment in <strong>the Department of Electrical Engineering</strong> and <strong>the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering</strong>. Prior to joining NTU, I recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, where I worked in the <a href='http://clvrai.com/' target='_blank'>Cognitive Learning for Vision and Robotics Lab (CLVR)</a>. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from NTU. My research interests span <strong>Robot Learning</strong>, <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, and <strong>Program Synthesis</strong>."
    hiring: "<p><span style='color: #902a1f;'><strong>Hiring news</strong></span>: I am looking for students interested in robot learning, reinforcement learning, machine learning, program synthesis, or related areas. Specifically, I am hiring <strong>M.S.</strong> and <strong>Ph.D. students</strong> admitted to the Data Science and Smart Networking Group at the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering (電信所丙組/資料科學與智慧網路組) or the Data Science Degree Program (資料科學學位學程) at NTU. Also, I am seeking <strong>undergraduate students</strong>, <strong>research assistants</strong>, and <strong>visiting students/scholars</strong> with different experience levels.
