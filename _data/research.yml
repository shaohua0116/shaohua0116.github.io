abstract: "My research focuses on developing a robot learning framework that enables robots to acquire long-horizon and complex skills with hierarchical structures, such as furniture assembly and cooking. Specifically, I present a <strong>program-guided robot learning framework</strong> that is interpretable, generalizable/programmatic, hierarchical, and modular. To this end, this framework represents desired behaviors as a program as well as acquires and utilizes primitive skills for learning to execute desired skills. Instead of learning in an end-to-end manner, I propose to design specialized learning modules that aim to (1) perform <strong>program inference</strong> to explicitly infer underlying programs that describe the skills of interest, (2) <strong>acquire primitive skills</strong> that can be used to compose more complex and longer-horizon skills, and (3) perform <strong>task execution</strong> by following the inferred program and utilizing acquired primitive skills to replicate the desired skills."
