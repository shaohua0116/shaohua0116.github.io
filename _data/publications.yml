  abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) aims at learning policies to solve decision-making problems. However, previous approaches employed neural network policies for policy learning, making it hard to interpret the decision-making process. On the other hand, prior works (Trivedi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023; Carvalho et al., 2024) proposed to use human-readable programs as policies to increase the interpretability of the decision-making pipeline. However, programmatic policies generated by (Trivedi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023; Carvalho et al., 2024) can not effectively solve long and repetitive RL tasks and can not generalize to even longer horizon during testing. To solve these problems, we propose the Hierarchical Programmatic Option framework (HIPO), which aims to solve long and repetitive RL problems with human-readable programs as options (low-level policies). Specifically, we proposed a method that retrieves a set of effective, diverse, and compatible programs as options (programmatic options). Then, we learn a high-level policy to effectively reuse these programmatic options to solve reoccurring subtasks. Our proposed framework outperforms programmatic RL and deep RL baselines on various tasks. Ablation studies justify the effectiveness of our proposed search algorithm for retrieving a set of programmatic options.'

  abstract: 'Learning from Observation (LfO) aims to imitate experts by learning from state-only demonstrations without requiring action labels. Existing adversarial imitation learning approaches learn a generator agent policy to produce state transitions that are indistinguishable to a discriminator that learns to classify agent and expert state transitions. Despite its simplicity in formulation, these methods are often sensitive to hyperparameters and brittle to train. Motivated by the recent success of diffusion models in generative modeling, we propose to integrate a diffusion model into the adversarial imitation learning from observation framework. Specifically, we employ a diffusion model to capture expert and agent transitions by generating the next state, given the current state. Then, we reformulate the learning objective to train the diffusion model as a binary classifier and use it to provide ``realness'' rewards for policy learning. Our proposed framework, Diffusion Imitation from Observation (DIFO), demonstrates superior performance in various continuous control domains, including navigation, locomotion, manipulation, and games.'

  abstract: "Imitation learning aims to learn a policy from observing expert demonstrations without access to reward signals from environments. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) formulates imitation learning as adversarial learning, employing a generator policy learning to imitate expert behaviors and discriminator learning to distinguish the expert demonstrations from agent trajectories. Despite its encouraging results, GAIL training is often brittle and unstable. Inspired by the recent dominance of diffusion models in generative modeling, this work proposes Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning (DRAIL), which integrates a diffusion model into GAIL, aiming to yield more precise and smoother rewards for policy learning. Specifically, we propose a diffusion discriminative classifier to construct an enhanced discriminator; then, we design diffusion rewards based on the classifier's output for policy learning. We conduct extensive experiments in navigation, manipulation, and locomotion, verifying DRAIL's effectiveness compared to prior imitation learning methods. Moreover, additional experimental results demonstrate the generalizability and data efficiency of DRAIL. Visualized learned reward functions of GAIL and DRAIL suggest that DRAIL can produce more precise and smoother rewards."

  abstract: 'Unsupervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to learn the mapping between the speech signal and its corresponding textual transcription without the supervision of paired speech-text data. A word/phoneme in the speech signal is represented by a segment of speech signal with variable length and unknown boundary, and this segmental structure makes learning the mapping between speech and text challenging, especially without paired data. In this paper, we propose REBORN, Reinforcement-Learned Boundary Segmentation with Iterative Training for Unsupervised ASR. REBORN alternates between (1) training a segmentation model that predicts the boundaries of the segmental structures in speech signals and (2) training the phoneme prediction model, whose input is a segmental structure segmented by the segmentation model, to predict a phoneme transcription. Since supervised data for training the segmentation model is not available, we use reinforcement learning to train the segmentation model to favor segmentations that yield phoneme sequence predictions with a lower perplexity. We conduct extensive experiments and find that under the same setting, REBORN outperforms all prior unsupervised ASR models on LibriSpeech, TIMIT, and five non-English languages in Multilingual LibriSpeech. We comprehensively analyze why the boundaries learned by REBORN improve the unsupervised ASR performance.'

By synthesizing videos that “hallucinate” robot executing actions and in combination with dense correspondences between frames, our approach can infer the closed-formed action to execute to an environment without the need of any explicit action labels. This unique capability allows us to train the policy solely based on RGB videos and deploy learned policies to various robotic tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in learning policies on table-top manipulation and navigation tasks. Additionally, we contribute an open-source framework for efficient video modeling, enabling the training of high-fidelity policy models with four GPUs within a single day.'

  abstract: 'Despite recent advancements, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) still struggles at learning sparse-reward goal-directed tasks, while classical planning excels at addressing hierarchical tasks, yet most of the methods rely on assumptions about pre-defined subtasks. To bridge the best of both worlds, we propose a framework that integrates DRL with classical planning by automatically inducing task structures and substructures from a few demonstrations. Specifically, we adopt abstraction mapping formulation and define critical actions that lead to the transition at the abstraction level. The framework induces critical action schemata regarded as subtasks to solve the problems. Symbolic regression is used for substructure induction by employing genetic programming where the program model reflects prior domain knowledge of effect rules. We compare the proposed framework to state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, imitation learning methods, and an exploration approach in various domains. Experimental results on various tasks show that our proposed framework outperforms all the abovementioned algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and task performance. Moreover, our framework achieves strong generalization performance by effectively inducing new rules and composing task structures. Ablation studies justify the design of our induction module and the proposed genetic programming procedure.'

  abstract: 'Aiming to produce reinforcement learning (RL) policies that are human-interpretable and can generalize better to novel scenarios, Trivedi et al. (2021) present a method (LEAPS) that first learns a program embedding space to continuously parameterize diverse programs from a pre-generated program dataset, and then searches for a task-solving program in the learned program embedding space when given a task. Despite encouraging results, the program policies that LEAPS can produce are limited by the distribution of the program dataset. Furthermore, during searching, LEAPS evaluates each candidate program solely based on its return, failing to precisely reward correct parts of programs and penalize incorrect parts. To address these issues, we propose to learn a meta-policy that composes a series of programs sampled from the learned program embedding space. By composing programs, our proposed method can produce program policies that describe out-of-distributionally complex behaviors and directly assign credits to programs that induce desired behaviors. We design and conduct extensive experiments in the Karel domain. The experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms baselines. The ablation studies confirm the limitations of LEAPS and justify our design choices.'

  abstract: 'This work introduces a novel task, location-aware visual question generation (LocaVQG), which aims to generate engaging questions from data relevant to a particular geographical location. Specifically, we represent such location-aware information with surrounding images and a GPS coordinate. To tackle this task, we present a dataset generation pipeline that leverages GPT-4 to produce diverse and sophisticated questions. Then, we aim to learn a lightweight model that can address the LocaVQG task and fit on an edge device, such as a mobile phone. To this end, we propose a method which can reliably generate engaging questions from location-aware information. Our proposed method outperforms baselines regarding human evaluation (e.g., engagement, grounding, coherence) and automatic evaluation metrics (e.g., BERTScore, ROUGE-2). Moreover, we conduct extensive ablation studies to justify our proposed techniques for both generating the dataset and solving the task.'

QMP learns to selectively share exploratory behavior between tasks by using a mixture of policies based on estimated discounted returns to gather training data. '
  abstract: 'The ability to leverage shared behaviors between tasks is critical for sample efficient multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL). Prior approaches based on parameter sharing or policy distillation share behaviors uniformly across tasks and states or focus on learning one optimal policy. Therefore, they are fundamentally limited when tasks have conflicting behaviors because no one optimal policy exists. Our key insight is that we can instead share exploratory behavior which can be helpful even when the optimal behaviors differ. Furthermore, as we learn each task, we can guide the exploration by sharing behaviors in a task and state dependent way. To this end, we propose a novel MTRL method, Q-switch Mixture of policies (QMP), that learns to selectively share exploratory behavior between tasks by using a mixture of policies based on estimated discounted returns to gather training data. Experimental results in manipulation and locomotion tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms prior behavior sharing methods, high- lighting the importance of task and state dependent sharing.'

  abstract: 'While deep reinforcement learning methods have shown impressive results in robot learning, their sample inefficiency makes the learning of complex, long-horizon behaviors with real robot systems infeasible. To mitigate this issue, meta-reinforcement learning methods aim to enable fast learning on novel tasks by learning how to learn. Yet, the application has been limited to short-horizon tasks with dense rewards. To enable learning long-horizon behaviors, recent works have explored leveraging prior experience in the form of offline datasets without reward or task annotations. While these approaches yield improved sample efficiency, millions of interactions with environments are still required to solve complex tasks. In this work, we devise a method that enables meta-learning on long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks, allowing us to solve unseen target tasks with orders of magnitude fewer environment interactions. Our core idea is to leverage prior experience extracted from offline datasets during meta-learning. Specifically, we propose to (1) extract reusable skills and a skill prior from offline datasets, (2) meta-train a high-level policy that learns to efficiently compose learned skills into long-horizon behaviors, and (3) rapidly adapt the meta-trained policy to solve an unseen target task. Experimental results on continuous control tasks in navigation and manipulation demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently solve long-horizon novel target tasks by combining the strengths of meta-learning and the usage of offline datasets, while prior approaches in RL, meta-RL, and multi-task RL require substantially more environment interactions to solve the tasks.'

  abstract: 'Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have achieved impressive performance on tasks in a variety of domains. However, neural network poli- cies produced with DRL methods are not human-interpretable and often have difficulty generalizing to novel scenarios. To address these issues, prior works explore learning programmatic policies that are more interpretable and structured for generalization. Yet, these works either employ limited policy representations (e.g. decision trees, state machines, or predefined program templates) or require stronger supervision (e.g. input/output state pairs or expert demonstrations). We present a framework that instead learns to synthesize a program, which details the procedure to solve a task in a flexible and expressive manner, solely from reward signals. To alleviate the difficulty of learning to compose programs to induce the desired agent behavior from scratch, we propose to first learn a program embedding space that continuously parameterizes diverse behaviors in an unsupervised manner and then search over the learned program embedding space to yield a program that maximizes the return for a given task. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only learns to reliably synthesize task-solving pro- grams but also outperforms DRL and program synthesis baselines while producing interpretable and more generalizable policies. We also justify the necessity of the proposed two-stage learning scheme as well as analyze various methods for learning the program embedding.'

  abstract: 'Developing agents that can learn to follow natural language instructions has been an emerging research direction. While being accessible and flexible, natural language instructions can sometimes be ambiguous even to humans. To address this, we propose to utilize programs, structured in a formal language, as a precise and expressive way to specify tasks. We then devise a modular framework that learns to perform a task specified by a program – as different circumstances give rise to diverse ways to accomplish the task, our framework can perceive which circumstance it is currently under, and instruct a multitask policy accordingly to fulfill each subtask of the overall task. Experimental results on a 2D Minecraft environment not only demonstrate that the proposed framework learns to reliably accomplish program instructions and achieves zero-shot generalization to more complex instructions but also verify the efficiency of the proposed modulation mechanism for learning the multitask policy. We also conduct an analysis comparing various models which learn from programs and natural language instructions in an end-to-end fashion.'

  desc: 'We aim to synthesize a target image with an arbitrary camera pose from multipple given source images. We propose an end-to-end trainable framework which consists of a flow prediction module and a pixel generation module to directly leverage information presented in source views as well as hallucinate missing pixels from statistical priors. We introduce a self-learned confidence aggregation mechanism to merge the predictions produced by the two modules given multi-view source images.'
  abstract: 'We address the task of multi-view novel view synthesis, where we are interested in synthesizing a target image with an arbitrary camera pose from given source images. We propose an end-to-end trainable framework that learns to exploit multiple viewpoints to synthesize a novel view without any 3D supervision. Specifically, our model consists of a flow prediction module and a pixel generation module to directly leverage information presented in source views as well as hallucinate missing pixels from statistical priors. To merge the predictions produced by the two modules given multi-view source images, we introduce a self-learned confidence aggregation mechanism. We evaluate our model on images rendered from 3D object models as well as real and synthesized scenes. We demonstrate that our model is able to achieve state-of-the-art results as well as progressively improve its predictions when more source images are available.'

  desc: 'Interpreting decision making logic in demonstration videos is key to collaborating with and mimicking humans. To empower machines with this ability, we propose a framework that is able to explicitly synthesize underlying programs from behaviorally diverse and visually complicated demonstration videos. We introduce a summarizer module to improve the network’s ability to integrate multiple demonstrations and employ a multi-task objective to encourage the model to learn meaningful intermediate representations.'
  abstract: 'Interpreting decision making logic in demonstration videos is key to collaborating with and mimicking humans. To empower machines with this ability, we propose a neural program synthesizer that is able to explicitly synthesize underlying programs from behaviorally diverse and visually complicated demonstration videos. We introduce a summarizer module as part of our model to improve the network’s ability to integrate multiple demonstrations varying in behavior. We also employ a multi-task objective to encourage the model to learn meaningful intermediate representations for end-to-end training. We show that our model is able to reliably synthesize underlying programs as well as capture diverse behaviors exhibited in demonstrations.'

  desc: 'Without any prior knowledge or user interaction, single image rain removal has been a challenging task. By observing the limitations of standard batch-mode learning-based methods, we propose to exploit the structural similarity of the image bases for solving this task. By formulating the basis selection as an optimization problem, we are able to disregard those associated with rain patterns while the detailed image information can be preserved. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world images will verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.'
